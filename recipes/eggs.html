    <h2>Eggs - Chicken Periods</h2>
        <p>Yes, eggs are chicken periods. Yes, that's gross to think about.</p> 
        <p>But really all meat and animal byproduct consumption is a moral and ethical mess, 
           so why concern yourself with any of that?</p>
        <p>And anyway this is a recipe page so let's get crackin! (hehe)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs (2-3)</li>
            <li>Butter (1 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat skillet on medium heat.</li>
            <li>When skillet has warmed add 1 tbsp butter and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs <strong>flat on the counter.</strong> 
                <em>You run the risk of shell in your egg if you crack it on the edge of the pan.</em></li>
            <li>Cook each egg until you see the whites of the eggs start to gently bubble.</li>
            <li>When the edges of the egg have turned white and are gently bubbling flip the egg.</li>
            <li>Cook an additional 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, serve with buttered toast.</li>
        </ol>
