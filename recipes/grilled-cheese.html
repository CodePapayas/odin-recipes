    <h2>Grilled Cheese - A Timeless Classic</h2>
        <p><strong>I love grilled cheese!</strong> It's a classic pick-me-up that never fails to warm my spirits. The lord has blessed us with melty cheese, and for that I am forever grateful.</p>
        <p>But though this recipe looks simple enough it can easily go very, very wrong. The proper grilled cheese is one with a golden crust and perfect, golden, melted cheese in the middle.</p>
        <p>Cook it too long, or on too high of heat, and you'll burn the bread before you melt the cheese. Cook it too low and you'll never melt the cheese or butter before the bread gets soggy.</p>
        <p>Truly, this is an artform.</p>
