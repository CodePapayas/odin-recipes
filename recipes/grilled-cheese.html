    <h2>Grilled Cheese - A Timeless Classic</h2>
        <p><strong>I love grilled cheese!</strong> It's a classic pick-me-up that never fails to warm my spirits. The lord has blessed us with melty cheese, and for that I am forever grateful.</p>
        <p>But though this recipe looks simple enough it can easily go very, very wrong. The proper grilled cheese is one with a golden crust and perfect, golden, melted cheese in the middle.</p>
        <p>Cook it too long, or on too high of heat, and you'll burn the bread before you melt the cheese. Cook it too low and you'll never melt the cheese or butter before the bread gets soggy.</p>
        <p>Truly, this is an artform.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two slices of bread</li>
            <li>Two slices of cheddar cheese (thick af bruh)</li>
            <li>Softened butter (for the bread AND pan)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat skillet on medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Spread butter evenly on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>When pan is hot add 1tbsp butter.</li>
            <li>Carefully arrange your slices of cheese on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Put the buttery cheddar bread in the pan butter-side down.</li>
            <li>Cover with a pan or baking sheet (whatever's clever here, key is to trap heat).</li>
            <li>When cheese is partially melted add the other slice of bread (butter-side up!) and flip the sucker over.</li>
            <li>Cook another 2-3 minutes until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Cut that beauty in half with the spatula. It's pretty satisfying.</li>
            <li>Ya done! Congrats!</li>
